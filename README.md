With Botfront you can:

- Build advanced **multilingual** conversational agents 🌎
- Write and train **stories** 📖
- Create, train, and evaluate **NLU** models 🤓
- Create and edit your bot responses 👩‍🎨
- Monitor conversations, review and annotate incoming NLU utterances 👌

## Version Control

Clone the project as usual then run `git push -u origin master` to set origin as the default remote. **Don't miss this step** or you might push on the open source repo by accident.
### Getting started

Just...

```bash
npm install -g botfront
```

And...

```bash
botfront
```

Then run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/botfront/botfront` to add the open source repo as another remote source.

Now, everytime you want to integrate the latest changes from the open source repo, just run `git pull upstream stable`
