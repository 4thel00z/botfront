A visual and intuitive platform to build chatbots with Rasa

## Version Control

Clone the project as usual then run `git push -u origin master` to set origin as the default remote. **Don't miss this step** or you might push on the open source repo by accident.

Then run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/botfront/botfront` to add the open source repo as another remote source.

Now, everytime you want to integrate the latest changes from the open source repo, just run `git pull upstream stable`
