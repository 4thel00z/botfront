<h2 name="quick-start" align="center">Quick Start</h2>

Botfront only requires a recent version of Docker. You can install the CLI with the following:

```bash
npm install -g botfront
```

Then just run `botfront`to get started.

<br/>
<h2 name="documentation" align="center">Documentation</h2>

The [official documentation](https://botfront.io/docs) of Botfront is hosted on [botfront.io](https://botfront.io/docs). It is automatically built and updated on every new release.

If you need run the documentation elsewhere you can build a Docker container as follows:
```bash
# From the root of the repo
docker build -t botfront/botfront-docs botfront/docs
```

To serve the docs on port 8080 (e.g. `https://localhost:8080`):
```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 botfront/botfront-docs
```

### Installation

1. Botfront is a Meteor app, so the first step is to [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)
2. Then clone this repo and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/botfront/botfront
cd botfront/botfront
meteor npm install
```
3. Install the CLI from the source code:
```bash
# if you installed Botfront from npm uninstall it.
npm uninstall -g botfront
# Install the cli from the source code
cd cli && npm link
```
Botfront needs to be connected to other services, especially Rasa. To do this, you need to create a regular project, and start Botfront with a dedicated configuration:

1. Create a Botfront project with `botfront init` (somewhere else, not in the repo)
2. Start your project with `botfront up -e botfront`. This will run all services except the Botfront app, since you are going to run it with Meteor locally
3. Run Botfront with `meteor npm run start:docker-compose.dev`. Botfront will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Contribute

We ‚ù§Ô∏è contributions of all size and sorts. If you find a typo, if you want to improve a section of the documentation or if you want to help with a bug or a feature, here are the steps:

1. Fork the repo and create a new branch, say `fix-botfront-typo-1`
2. Fix/improve the codebase
3. Commit the changes. **Commit message must follow [the naming convention](#naming-convention)**, say `fix(conversation builder): display story groups in alphabetical order`
4. Make a pull request. **Pull request name must follow [the naming convention](#naming-convention)**. It can simply be one of your commit messages, just copy paste it, e.g. `fix(readme): improve the readability and move sections`
5. Submit your pull request and wait for all checks passed (up to an hour)
6. Request reviews from one of the developers from our core team.
7. Get a üëç and PR gets merged.

Well done! Once a PR gets merged, here are the things happened next:
- all Docker images tagged with `branch-master` will be automatically updated in an hour. You may check the status on the [Actions](https://github.com/botfront/botfront/actions) tab.
- your contribution and commits will be included in [our weekly release note](https://github.com/gnes-ai/gnes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). üçª

<h3 name="naming-convention" align="center">Commits naming convention</h3>

To help everyone with understanding the commit history of Botfront, we employ [`commitlint`](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) to enforce the commit styles:

```text
type(scope?): subject
```

where `type` is one of the following:

- build
- ci
- chore
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

`scope` is optional, represents the module your commit working on.

`subject` explains the commit.

As an example, a commit that improved the documentation:
```text
docs(conversation builder): update slots manager screenshot.
```
