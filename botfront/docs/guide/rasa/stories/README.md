# Develop conversations

Botfront is based on Rasa and provides interfaces to visually and efficiently build and edit Rasa stories.

## Stories

Stories are the building blocks of conversation flows. It's a symbolic language used to describe conversations a user can have with a bot. In their simplest form, stories are made of annotated user messages and bot responses.

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![SimpleÂ stories](../../../images/stories_cob_1.png)

As you can see, this is partially natural language: a user message example is annotated with an **_intent_** and the bot response content is displayed alongside its **_response name_** (on hover/when clicked).

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Simple stories](../../../images/stories_bf_1.png)

In markdown, user messages start with a `*`, and bot responses start with a `-`. As you can see this is not real natural language: the user message is expressed in the form of an **_intent_**, and the bot response with a **_response name_**. The content of this intent (the many ways to say **_hi_**) can be any example in your model.

:::

::: tab "Standard Rasa"

``` md
* chitchat.greet
  - utter_hi_there
```

``` md
* chitchat.bye
  - utter_bye
```

In markdown, user messages start with a `*`, and bot responses start with a `-`. As you can see this is not real natural language: the user message is expressed in the form of an **_intent_**, and the bot response with a **_response name_**. The content of this intent (the many ways to say **_hi_**) can be any example in your model corresponding to the denoted intent.

:::

::::

::: tip
This has an important implication: **stories are language agnostic**. The stories you write will work in any language.
:::

::: warning
If there is no response content defined for a certain language, the response name (like _utter_something_) will be displayed in your chat. Be sure to add response content for all of your languages.
:::

## Stories and context

The context of a conversation is the knowledge of all the passed events of this conversation.

In the story above (previous section), if you say **_Hi_** three times to the bot, it will reply the same thing three times. To prevent that, consider this example:

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Context story](../../../images/stories_cob_2.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Context story](../../../images/stories_bf_2.png)

:::

::: tab "Standard Rasa"

``` md
* chitchat.greet
  - utter_hi_there
* chitchat.greet
  - utter_hi_again
* chitchat.greet
  - utter_hmm_really
```

:::

::::

## Branching conversations

Conversations are often designed as tree-like flow charts. Stories are *real* conversation examples. Simply click on the **Branch Story** button on the story footer:

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Branching button](../../../images/branching_cob_1.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Branching button](../../../images/branching_bf_1.png)

:::

::::

### Branching with intents

The simplest way to branch a conversation is to use different intents at some point. Consider the following stories where two different paths (_happy_ and _sad_) are implemented:

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Branch 1: happy](../../../images/branching_cob_2.png)

![Branch 2: sad](../../../images/branching_cob_3.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Branch 1: happy](../../../images/branching_bf_2.png)

![Branch 2: sad](../../../images/branching_bf_3.png)

:::

::: tab "Standard Rasa"

_For Rasa, you need to create two separate stories, where half of the story is duplicated. It may not be a big problem in a simple implementation like this, but when your conversation tree branches on several levels,this will become very difficult to maintain._

``` md {3}
* chitchat.greet
  - utter_hi_how_are_you
* chitchat.i_am_happy
  - utter_awesome
```

``` md {3}
* chitchat.greet
  - utter_hi_how_are_you
* chitchat.i_am_sad
  - utter_i_have_a_bad_day_myself
```

:::

::::

### Annotating with entities

Here you can see an example of how you can use entities while annotating in the conversation builder, which would be required for advanced branching:

![Entity annotation flow](../../../images/annotation_entity_flow_cob_1.png)

::: tip

Simply highlight the part (entity value) you want to annotate. From the popup, you may create a new entity, or select from an existing one in your model.

:::

### Branching with entity values

Another way is to use entity values. Here we want to implement the following use case: a user can ask to book in _eco_ or _business_. The third path covers the case where no class is specified. This can be done as follows with branches:

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Branch 1: book-eco](../../../images/branching_cob_4.png)

![Branch 2: book-business](../../../images/branching_cob_5.png)

![Branch 3: book-undecided](../../../images/branching_cob_6.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Branch 1: book-eco](../../../images/branching_bf_4.png)

![Branch 2: book-business](../../../images/branching_bf_5.png)

![Branch 3: book-undecided](../../../images/branching_bf_6.png)

:::

::: tab "Standard Rasa"

_Similar to the previous example, here Rasa requires three separate stories with a lot of duplication:_

``` md {3}
* chitchat.greet
  - utter_hi_how_are_you
* book{"class":"eco"}
  - utter_eco
```

``` md {3}
* chitchat.greet
  - utter_hi_how_are_you
* book{"class":"business"}
  - utter_business
```

``` md {3}
* chitchat.greet
  - utter_hi_how_are_you
* book
  - utter_which_class
```

:::

::::

::: warning But wait, that doesn't work!
If you train and try this story, you'll see that if you type `/book` the agent will utter `utter_which_class` as expected, but if you type `/book{"class":"eco"}` or `/book{"class":"business"}` the response will be random. The reason is that if the value of the entity is not stored somewhere, Rasa only differentiates the flow looking at if the entity `class` exists or not in the user utterance.

If you want the stories above to work, you need to **create a slot**. In this case we're going to create a **categorical** slot, and add the categories **business** and **eco**. Then retrain and it should work.

![Categorical slot](../../../images/branching_7.png)

:::

### Branching with slots

Once you define a slot with the same name as an entity, any entity value extracted from a user message will be set as the slot value, and this value will persist accross the conversation until it is changed or reset. This means that if a user said one of the sentences above (_I want to book in economy_ `book{"class":"eco"}` or _I want to book in business_`book{"class":"business"}`), you can still use that information to branch your conversation.

**Use case**: a user wants to cancel a booking, but only `business` bookings are cancellable. You can implement that as follows with branches:

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Branch 1: cancel-eco](../../../images/branching_cob_8.png)

![Branch 2: cancel-business](../../../images/branching_cob_9.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Branch 1: cancel-eco](../../../images/branching_bf_8.png)

![Branch 2: cancel-business](../../../images/branching_bf_9.png)

:::

::: tab "Standard Rasa"

_In Rasa, you would have to write two additional separate stories:_

``` md {2}
* cancel.booking
  - slot{"class":"eco"}
  - utter_booking_not_cancellable
```

``` md {2}
* cancel.booking
  - slot{"class":"business"}
  - utter_booking_canceled
```

:::

::::

As you can see, the `- slot{"class":"..."}` in the branches guides the conversation into different paths.

::: tip What if the class has not been set yet?
You can add a third category **not_set** to the `class` slot in a new branch, and set the initial value to **not_set**. Then you can gracefully handle the case where no class is set like this:

:::

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Branch 3: cancel-notset](../../../images/branching_cob_10.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Branch 3: cancel-notset](../../../images/branching_bf_10.png)

:::

::: tab "Standard Rasa"

``` md {2}
* cancel.booking
  - slot{"class":"not_set"}
  - utter_which_class
```

:::

::::

### How branches are handled

Under the hood, Botfront uses [Rasa checkpoints](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/stories/#checkpoints). When you click **branch story**, the parent and child stories are linked seamlessly with checkpoints, without the need of additional handling on the front end.

### Other branching features

You can easily see which branch you're on by looking at the breadcrumbs on the story footer:

![Branching breadcrumbs](../../../images/branching_11.png)

You can rename the branches as desired by clicking on the branch name and add as many as you want using the **+** icon:

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Rename branch](../../../images/branching_cob_12.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Rename branch](../../../images/branching_bf_12.png)

:::

::::

You can delete branches by clicking the trash icon while on the selected branch:

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Delete branch](../../../images/branching_cob_13.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Delete branch](../../../images/branching_bf_13.png)

:::

::::

::: tip NOTE
Deleting either one of the last two branches would automatically delete the other branch as well. The content in the last remaining branch will be added to the parent story.
:::

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Delete last branch](../../../images/branching_cob_14.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Delete last branch](../../../images/branching_bf_14.png)

## Linking stories

Linking stories is a powerful way to prevent repetition, and to easily connect stories with each other. You may simply select a story as a destination on the right side of the story footer. Any story can be linked to any story, or be used as a destination. This feature is especially useful where you would want to present a frequently repeated flow in the end of multiple stories, like a **feedback** flow.

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Link story](../../../images/linking_cob_1.png)

![Story linked](../../../images/linking_cob_2.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Link story](../../../images/linking_bf_1.png)

![Story linked](../../../images/linking_bf_2.png)

:::

::::

When a story is set as a destination, this is shown by a yellow information bar on the story header.

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Destination story](../../../images/linking_cob_3.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Destination story](../../../images/linking_bf_3.png)

:::

::::

A list of linked stories would be available when clicked on the bar.

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Destination story detail](../../../images/linking_cob_4.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Destination story detail](../../../images/linking_bf_4.png)

:::

::::

Stories that are destination stories or that have links cannot be deleted until the linking is removed.

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Destination story no delete](../../../images/linking_cob_5.png)

![Initial story no delete](../../../images/linking_cob_6.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Destination story no delete](../../../images/linking_bf_5.png)

![Initial story no delete](../../../images/linking_bf_6.png)

:::

::::

Branches can be linked to other stories as well.

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Linked branch 1: Good](../../../images/linking_cob_7.png)

![Linked branch 2: Sad](../../../images/linking_cob_8.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Linked branch 1: Good](../../../images/linking_bf_7.png)

![Linked branch 2: Sad](../../../images/linking_bf_8.png)

:::

::::

::: tip
Using linking too much could overcomplicate your story flows, making them difficult to understand. Also, excessive usage could lead into an increase in training time.
:::

### Linking a story to itself

Linking a story to itself is only available on a story that has branches. For example, this can be used to create a menu dialogue, with a "go back" option looping back to the start of the story.
However, when using this feature, the story that is linking to itself also needs to be a destination story of another story, that will serve as an introduction story to the loop. **Otherwise, the self linking story would not be reachable.**

Schema of a self linking story (Menu story) with an intro story:

![Self linking schema](../../../images/story_self_link.png)

A sample self-linked story:

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Self-linked story](../../../images/linking_cob_9.png)

:::

::: tab "Botfront Markdown"

![Self-linked story](../../../images/linking_bf_9.png)

:::

::::

### How linking is handled

Similar to branching, Botfront uses [Rasa checkpoints](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/stories/#checkpoints) to accommodate linking as well. When you click **Link to**, the originating and destination stories are linked seamlessly with checkpoints. Please note that `> checkpoints` are not allowed in stories.

## Organizing your stories in groups

Stories are grouped in story groups in order to keep them neat and tidy. You can create as many story groups as you want and rename them if necessary. When you delete the last story in a story group, the group is also deleted.

By selecting the **Move** icon as seen below, you may move any story to any story group.

![Move story](../../../images/move_story.png)

<!---
### Duplicating stories

You may duplicate stories using the **Duplicate** icon next to the Move icon.
--->

### Renaming stories

Stories can be renamed on the story header.

![Rename story](../../../images/rename_story.png)

### Collapsing and expanding stories

In order to easily focus on one or a few stories, you can collapse or expand stories using the caret on the left of the story header.

### Special group: Intro stories

The **Intro stories** group contains the initial messages that would be sent to users when they start chatting with your bot. The starting payloads of those stories
will be available in the **bold** menu at the top of the chat widget.

This allows to test different starting workflows, for example if you want the welcome message of your bot to be different on several pages of your website. Note that you will still have to implement that on your frontend. If you are using the Rasa Webchat widget you can do that by customizing the `initPayload` parameter.

The **Intro stories** group is created by default in every new project.

## Optimize training for faster development

By default, the NLU and all stories are trained when you click on **Train everything** on the right side of the header in Botfront.
Depending on the policies you are using and the number of stories, training can take a significant amount of time. To help you iterate faster on subsets of your dialogue, you may focus on one or multiple story group to train the NLU and just the stories they contain.

You may click on the **focus (eye)** icon which appears when you hover besides story group names. Please note that the blue Train everything button will change to a yellow **Partial training** button, and it will have a tooltip stating the number of stories that are going to be trained.

![Story group hover](../../../images/story_focus_1.png)

![Story group focus](../../../images/story_focus_2.png)

![Story group focus](../../../images/story_focus_3.png)

![Partial training button](../../../images/story_focus_4.png)

## Warnings and errors

The display of warnings and errors is a very useful part of the story editor. It guides you when you write your stories for them to work properly, and prevents training if there's an error that would affect the model and the chat experience.

When there is a warning or an error, it is flagged on the corresponding line, and also indicated on the story header. When you hover over the icon, you get a suggestive explanation to resolve the issue.

:::: tabs

::: tab "Conversation builder"

![Warning hover](../../../images/warnings_and_errors_cob_1.png)

Warnings and errors cover a comprehensive list of possible situations, which are in line with Botfront updates.

## Default Domain Management

An important part of developing and maintaining a Rasa virtual assistant is keeping [domain files](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/domains/) up to date. Thankfully, Botfront makes this easier by automatically parsing the contents of your stories and extracting the different actions, entities, slots, etc. referenced within.

However, itâs not always possible to infer everything that needs to go into the domain. For example, you might need to invoke a custom action, which in turn invokes another action, or makes use of a slot.

![Default domain management](../../../images/default_domain_management_1.png)

## Disambiguation user input

When your virtual assistant receives a user utterance, it calculates, for each intent in your domain, the confidence that the utterance is an instance of that intent. Sooner or later, your virtual assistant will be faced with utterances where none of the calculated confidences are particularly high.

Itâs very often best to treat these cases separately, since it may mean that your virtual assistant does not understand, or is unsure. Within the Rasa framework, this is done using [policies](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/policies/).

#### Example usage

```
policies:
...
  - name: rasa_addons.core.policies.BotfrontDisambiguationPolicy
    fallback_trigger: 0.30
    disambiguation_trigger: '$0 < 2 * $1'
    deny_suggestions: 'deny_suggestions'
    n_suggestions: 3
    excluded_intents:
      - ^chitchat\..*
    disambiguation_title:
      en: "Sorry, I'm not sure I understood. Did you mean..."
      fr: "J'ai mal compris. Voulez-vous dire..."
    intent_mappings:
      password_lost:
        en: "Lost password"
        fr: "Mot de passe perdu"
      login_failed:
        en: "Login failed"
        fr: "ProblÃ¨me de connexion"
    deny_suggestions:
      en: "Something else"
      fr: "Autre chose"
...
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | What it does | type |
| ------- | --------------- |--------------- |
|`fallback_trigger`| if confidence of top-ranking intent is below this threshold, fallback is triggered. Fallback is an action that utters the template `utter_fallback` and returns to the previous conversation state. | `string` |
|`disambiguation_trigger`| e.g.: `'$0 < 2 * $1'`): if this expression holds, disambiguation is triggered. (If it has already been triggered on the previous turn, fallback is triggered instead.) Here this expression resolves to "the score of the top-ranking intent is below twice the score of the second-ranking intent". Disambiguation is an action that lets the user to choose from the top-ranking intents using a button prompt.<br/><br/>In addition, an 'Other' option is shown with payload defined in `deny_suggestions` param is shown. It is up to the conversation designer to implement a story to handle the continuation of this interaction. | `string` |
|`deny_suggestions`| The intent associated in the payload for the 'Other' option. | `string` |
|`excluded_intents`| Any intent (exactly) matching one of these regular expressions will not be shown as a suggestion. | `string` |
|`disambiguation_title`| Localized disambiguation message title. | `object` |
|`intent_mappings`| localized representative button title for intents. If no title is defined for a given intent, the intent name is rendered instead. These titles support entity substitution: any entity name enclosed in curly brackets (`{entity}`) will be filled with entity information from the user utterance. | `object` |

::: tip Important

The title for the 'Other' option is also defined here.
