# Setup

Run the following lines in a terminal window and type `Enter`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/botfront/botfront-starter
cd botfront-starter
docker-compose up
```

First, it's going to download all the Docker images required (it's going to take a while, be patient). Then it's going to start all the services. 
::: tip Note
You can safely ignore the errors in the logs: we just need to setup Botfront and it's all going to be fixed. 
:::


Open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) and follow the instructions. (If it doesn't work just wait a few more seconds for the service to be ready)
